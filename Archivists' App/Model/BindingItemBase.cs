  ///   Each derived class must call OnPropertyChanged in each of its property setters,
  ///   in order that the BindingList of which instantiations are items
  ///   will raise its ListChanged event
  ///   (with ListChangedEventArgs.ListChangedType == ListChangedType.ItemChanged)
  ///   when there there is a change to the value of a property of a new or existing item.
  ///   Each derived class should also be marked with
  ///   <see cref="NoReorderAttribute"/> to ensure that the order in which properties
  ///   are declared in the derived class will not change
  ///   when the Resharper code cleanup is run.
  /// </summary>
  /// <remarks>
  ///   The <see cref="NoReorderAttribute"/> is important because the property order
  ///   determines the order in which the corresponding columns will be displayed
  ///   on the grid.
  ///   Derived classes that were developed without <see cref="NoReorderAttribute"/>
  ///   did not actually have their property order changed by code cleanup,
  ///   presumably because their structure is so simple and, in particular,
  ///   they don't implement interfaces, which affect the code cleanup order.
  ///   Other derived classes are expected to be just as simple.
  ///   So the <see cref="NoReorderAttribute"/> is a safety feature.
